# Underflow and Overflow. 

## Description:
Underflow and overflow happened at Ethereum without any exceptions. See this [issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/796#issuecomment-253578925) to more cases.  

### To reproduce:

1. Copy-paste `_flow.sol` to remix (or use `Connect to localhost` feature) and deploy `_flow` contract. 
2. Play with `overflow` and `underflow` functions.
